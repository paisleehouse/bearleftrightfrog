          <p>Years ago, I watched many more movies than I do today. One of the ways that I watched movies was picking a
            director or series and consuming everything I could. As 2024 has unfolded, I have wnated to focus my
            attendion
            in a considered way. Less mindless consumption and scrolling, more concentrated efforts at enjoyment.

            2023 was a year of destruction and disccovery. I had been in therapy for a year. Learning and unlearning
            things about myself and the world around me. Discovering that I love hiking, music, yoga, books, learning,
            and so
            many other things. Destroying a persistent need to avoid and run away from people and difficult things.
            Ending a ten year relationshop and marriage.

            In the midst of all of this change, I found myself missing the way I used to seek out movies. I resolved to
            retry old ways. What better place to start in a celebration discovery, destruction, and new life than the
            Godzilla
            movies.</p>
